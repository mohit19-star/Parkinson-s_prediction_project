Overview

Parkinson's Disease is a degenerative disorder of the central nervous system that affects movement and quality of life. Early prediction of Parkinson's is essential for effective treatment and management. This project utilizes biomedical data to predict the likelihood of Parkinson's Disease using machine learning techniques.



Features

Data Preprocessing:
Handles missing values and normalizes the data for better model performance.
Feature Engineering:
Selects the most relevant features using statistical methods.
Machine Learning Models:
Implements algorithms such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, and Logistic Regression.
Evaluation Metrics:
Evaluates performance using metrics like accuracy, precision.
Dataset
The project uses the Parkinson's Disease Dataset.

Attributes: Target: A binary variable indicating the presence of Parkinson's Disease (1 for affected, 0 for healthy).

Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python

Libraries:

Data Manipulation: pandas, numpy
Data Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn
Machine Learning: scikit-learn

Usage
Run the Jupyter notebooks in the notebooks/ directory to explore the dataset and train models.
Alternatively, run the Python scripts in the src/ folder for specific tasks:
